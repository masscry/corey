## Description

Corey is a simple async framework that allows you to build asynchronous applications in C++. It provides a lightweight API for handling asynchronous tasks and managing concurrency. We are using io_uring to process IO requests and stackless C++20 coroutines for user code.

## Minimal Requirements

To use Corey, you need the following:

- C++20 compatible compiler
- Linux operating system
- io_uring library

Make sure you have these dependencies installed before proceeding with the installation and usage of Corey.

## Roadmap

 - [ ] Basic coroutine support `>_____<`
